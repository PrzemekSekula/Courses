# Courses

In this repo I am keeping the short courses I am (or was) learning. It serves only my learning purposes, mainly to remaind quickly what I was learning before :). All the credits should go where they belong - to the teachers and creators. 

### Currently in the repo:
- [AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen) by [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai/) in `./Autogen` folder
- [How Diffiusion Models Work](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/diffusion-models/) by [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai/) in `./DiffusionModels` folder
- [Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course) by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) in `rl-hgf` folder. **ONGOING**
